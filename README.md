# Solar-Flare
The Solar Flare charges cell phones, battery packs, and other handheld devices when access to electricity is unavailable. Such as when a family is out camping. Our product generates electricity using solar panels mounted onto a tripod. Sensors are used to track light, letting a gimbal rotate the solar panels for maximum exposure to light. The solar panels can also be adjusted manually, if needed.
